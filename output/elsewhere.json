Everyone is super nice. Cannot recommend this place enough.",

Crowd was mid 20s to early 30s.\nThe rooftop was nice, they did a good job with setting up smoke as ventilation. Bar staff were quick and friendly. Made drinks strong and pleasant.

Went to see \u201cThird Floor Sounds: JAEL, TEE EM DEE, BKG: SANGARANG, NICHE, bunkr. + more\u201d event.\nOnly three dance rooms were available for the night; not sure if they normally offer more or not. I was expecting to hear a lot of house music. They did play a little house but they also played dubstep, Edm, and something that just sounded like hardcore techno.\nThis place has a tap water station! Cups were beside it and you can help yourself to some water! I ordered one drink and it was $12. My bf ordered a club soda for $6. Coat check was $6. There is lots of staff/security around. \ud83d\udc4d\nThere is an outdoor section but no DJ out there; it\u2019s just for lounging out, smoking, etc.\nThe Hall was my favorite room because it\u2019s the largest and the lighting was very cool. They had tiny disco balls, one big one, and a few medium sized ones hung up. When they shine the lights on each other, it\u2019s super cool looking. Bass in the great hall is intense and loud, louder than any other club I\u2019ve been too. I\u2019m not sure why this is. Maybe the room is small for the speakers they got; maybe too strong for that room that size..idk. All in all, I\u2019d recommend to check it out at least once. Good energetic crowd too! No fights or problems. They placed a sticker on my camera  on my phone before walking in, to prevent you from filming and taking photos. Not sure why they did this\u2026",
