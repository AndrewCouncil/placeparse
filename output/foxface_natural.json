      "text": "I visited Foxface Natural for the first time to experience their New York New Wave wine evening. I usually lean towards more traditional/classic restaurants but has read so many good things about Foxface that it had been high on my list to try. I saw that they were hosting a special dinner offering 7 NY produce focused courses paired with 7 Finger Lake wines so that sounded like the perfect opportunity to check the restaurant out.\n\nThe building from outside is pretty inconspicuous (I actually walked by and had to walk back) but once you enter the staff are really welcoming and it feels quite cozy, despite it having a more clean and modern esthetic. I was sat at the bar and I have to admit that this was one of my favourite bar set up's that I have experienced.\n\nAs mentioned the menu was made up of 7 courses and, personally, some stood out for me more than others. Most of the dishes were well executed but some were definitely a little outside of my comfort zone (namely lamb tartar) however, the venison was very underdone. I had just assumed this was how venison should be served and didn\u2019t enjoy it due to personal preference so didn\u2019t mention anything at the time. I have since been told by several people with more experience with this protein that it is not how it should be served so I really wish I had said something at the time. The stand out dishes for me were the Red Shrimp Roll (delicious and so well seasoned), the sunchoke (which paired beautifully with the wine that was served with this, a real case of the dish enhancing the wine and vice versa) and the Girella. As well as the venison another disappointment for the evening was the panacotta, for me this was not as set as it should have been and was just generally a bit underwhelming.\n\nI also have to comment on the service. As a solo dinner they have really perfected making you feel looked after without being overbearing or rushed. I really enjoyed my interaction with all of the staff and they really seemed keen to get feedback on dishes.\n\nI don't know if I would return to Foxface Natural, it definitely made me realise I am more of a traditionalist when it comes to dining. I did enjoy how it pushed me out of my comfort zone and I tried dishes that I never normally would. I think if you like slightly more adventurous/exciting combinations then this would be your perfect spot. I did leave having enjoyed my evening and being very pleased that I had moved out of my comfort zone slightly.",

      "text": "Us two ordered a seafood pre-fix and a regular pre-fix and a la carte Kangaroo tartare. The highlighters were their sourdough bread and butter and Kangaroo tatare. Also, their SAUCIER IS DIVINE! I wished they could bottle all the sauces for sell.\n\nThey do sell the sourdough bread on weekends but I live tooooooo far away from them to take advantage of it.\n\nApps:\nBerkshire Pork Head & Pickled Oyster Bite\nThe rich gelatinous pork head paired perfectly with the tangy, salty pickled oyster\u2014absolutely seamless combo.\n\nSeafood Fritters & Karasumi (House Cured Mullet Roe)\nCrispy and light, packed with umami. The mullet roe adds depth\u2014well layered and satisfying.\n\nRaw seafood platter\nGriddle Point Oyster + Montauk Razor Clam + Bang Island Mussels + crab \ud83e\udd80\nSuper fresh and clean-tasting. Safe but solid picks. Bonuses for citrus \ud83c\udf4b\u200d\ud83d\udfe9 on the razor clams.\n\nNorth Carolina Bluefin Tuna Belly\nServed with house XO sauce, braised scallion (negi), and pomelo.\nRich, fatty tuna with a kick from the XO\u2014balanced by the citrus. Loved the XO sauce, extra homey for me.\n\nHiramasa \u201cPastrami\u201d\nDidn\u2019t care much for the fish flavor, but that firm but bouncy texture is quite appealing. The sauce on the side is incredible.\n\nWhite Asparagus\nWith Montauk whelk, cured egg yolk, seafood sauce, and tarragon oil.\nElegant plating, but the asparagus and whelk combo is more textural than flavorful. Glad they didn\u2019t overcook the asparagus. Ohhh the white sauce on the side is nothing like you would image. It is more than just creamy. You have to try it to figure out yourself.\n\nKuroda Carrots\nWith wild boar ham, spinach goat cheese sauce, and hazelnuts.\nThe carrot is deliciousssss! Hidden underneath the salty ham. The ham itself doesn\u2019t spark me that much.\n\nKangaroo Tartare\nWith spinach pur\u00e9e and Sardinian flatbread. The tartare has a strong scallion oil flavor that covers up the gaminess\u2014smart move. The cracker is additive, crispy and tasty: I can eat a whole bag of this. The puree!!!!! OMG how did they make spinach pur\u00e9e tasted like truffle! This one is a killer.\n\nMaine Uni Pascaline\nScallop and sweet prawn custard topped with Maine uni and fish roe.\nDelicate texture, with a whole lot of cream in it. Tasteful until the second bite. Also, two sides of the same coin: they used the whole scallop so kudos to sustainability yet I taste the fibers from the scallop shell and these made scallops tasted like daikons to us (both of us thought they were daikons initially).\n\nEntree\nBBQ Boer Goat\nWith recado negro, sour orange, and polenta beignets.\nSmoky, tangy, with a nice contrast in textures. Earthy and bold. By this point I am already full but that lamb packs smokiness and flavors. The beignets, however, was underwhelming. Quite dense in texture and does do much on the plate.\n\nSheephead\nYep you heard me right. A deep sea fish named Sheephead. Delicate in texture and flavor. Served with local long-island rice and tomato-based curry stay sauce.\n\nDessert\nFat Cat Cheese\nWith nigella & pistachio sauce, cranberry membrillo, and house-made cracker.\nNutty, sweet, and savory all at once\u2014fun cheese course. Cracker is thick and dense. Not sure if my cat likes them.\n\nTahini Gelato\nWith pomegranate molasses, sabl\u00e9, and pistachio.\nCreamy and nutty, with bright acidity from the molasses. Beautiful finish. My favorite out of the three.\n\nToffee Pudding\nLike the presentation, but it feels more like a cake than a pudding. A bit tooo dense in the middle. Caramel sauce, however, is a saving grace to that.\n\nUnfortunately didn\u2019t get the percebes (seasonal), but I wasn\u2019t disappointed at all. Their hospitality is great and they gave us a great spectrum of flavors and textures and nudged the creativity to the edge. (Also I really digged the silverwares! Funky and metallic). I am already planning on going again.",

      "text": "It hit the spot.\n\nI am a big seafood fan and was pleasantly surprised at the depth of experiential flavors.  Starting dish was oysters on fried hogs head, followed by a delicious trio of raw oyster, clam and razors.  It was my first time trying percebes (gooseneck barnacles), flown from Portugal, which have a delectable taste sitting between lobster and clam. Then I gratefully enjoyed the falling-off-the-bone halibut with homemade harissa.  Partner had hiramasa pastrami, turnip with boar ham, and a spicy main of Boer goat with excellent sour habanero sauce.  Dessert was cheese and a fantastic sticky toffee pudding that tasted of melted Werther\u2019s Originals.\n\nDid not get the wine pairing, but was recommended excellent wines by the glass and a salty water (Vichy Catalan) that was so nice I got one to go.  Excellent refreshment to match the food punches.  Partner and I were seated at the dining counter, where the seats were high and the atmosphere snappy and energetic.\n\nHighly recommend Foxface Natural if you want something daring and tasty.  Can tread right on the edge of your comfort zone or slide straight into taste oblivion.",
