The environment was so pleasant that it evoked a strong emotional response, and a wonderful aura seemed to permeate the space. The other patrons were also quite considerate. I found myself enjoying the music. The servers and host were attentive, promptly refilling my water glass. Although there was a wait, it was worthwhile, which leads me to my next point.\n\nThe food was exceptionally delicious and of the highest quality. While I only sampled the fried rice and a beverage, the flavors were unlike anything I have experienced, in a positive sense. Each element was exquisite, and the dishes appeared to be prepared with care, making me wish to explore the entire menu indefinitely.",

Not only were the portions huge but they were also all so so delicious. The moo ping stole the show, it was so tender and well seasoned- perfectly sweet and salty. We got the miang ka-na which was a little too sweet for us but loved how vinegar-y and bright the flavors were. The yum pla duk fu (catfish and mango salad) was the best - loved the tangy flavor and the textures. The entrees were clam with basil sauce and the pineapple curry duck. They were both amazing, semi similar in terms of taste profiles of the curries. The duck was a little more citrusy - the meat was very well cooked. Prices are beyond reasonable , food is amazing, quantity is more than enough, and the staff are incredibly kind and attentive. (Our server Mia was the best!!!)\n\nI will say we booked via google and it seemed like the system didn\u2019t go through to the restaurant itself so would be wary of that. The staff and owner are incredibly sweet though and sent a sticky mango rice!",

The portions were generous, and the menu had plenty of options for everyone. My favorite dish was the clams with basil sauce. The staff was friendly and quick, and the atmosphere was cozy but casual \u2014 great for a relaxed meal with friends or family. Overall, Saranrom Thai is definitely one of my new favorite spots for authentic Thai food at a great price. Highly recommend!",

The Bangkok beef salad was delicious\u2014crunch fresh vegetables and cooled stir fry beef.  My drunken noodles had a great flavor but the beef was a little tougher.  The pork skewers were delicious.  The only disappointment was the fried chicken wings which were very salty and a little less than average. The drinks in their unique glasses were too adorable. Great neighborhood spot\u2014would recommend.",

So flavorful and delicious, and the meat was amazing! Spring rolls were so fresh and hot. I was in Thailand over the summer and I absolutely approve of this place. Prices were so great, and great lunch specials! The drinks looked so cute as well!",
