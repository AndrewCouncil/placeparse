      "text": "Chanced upon this spot as we were going somewhere else for lunch down the block and decided to opt for it instead. I saw a painting of No-Face from Spirited Away on one of the walls at the corner of my eye and my inner spirit couldn\u2019t help but be excited after seeing that unexpectedly. This place also had something about it being Michelin posted on the door. I was a little confused, but after coming home and researching, I learned that it was 1-star Michelin Guide restaurant, meaning it was rated for high quality cooking.\n\nAccording to the Michelin Guide site, the rating is based on a 0-3 star system putting into consideration the quality of food based on (1) quality of ingredients, (2) mastery of flavor/cooking techniques, (3) flavor mastery/cooking technique, (4) personality of chef in the cuisine, and lastly, (5) value for money/consistency between visits.\n\nMy party of 4 ordered the Pork Katsu Curry, Yaki Curry, Shrimp Curry Udon, Chicken Salad & Miso Soup.\n\nThe Yaki Curry is the baked cheese-covered looking dish. It has rice under and the cheese was an orange-kind, probably cheddar or American? I did feel that it was a bit too cheesy for my preference, but it just being rice under didn\u2019t make it too heavy. The Pork Katsu Curry with rice was good. We opted for a level 2 spice (you can choose between 0-5 I believe it was with 5 being the spiciest). Level 2 was very mild that you could barely taste the spice for reference. The curry is on the side so you can choose to pour however much you want on it. The Shrimp Curry Udon was pretty good. The udon was thick, but smooth in so would recommend.\n\nOverall, it was a decent meal. Not necessarily mind-blowing after seeing the Michelin Guide recognition on the outside, but still a good spot to try out.",

      "text": "Pretty good. More like 3.5 stars.\nYaki Curry: Epitome of comfort food: Meat, Cheese, Rice and Gravy. I ordered low end of spicy and it still had little kick, tasted like togarashi spice. Definitely has truffle oil on top, that's the yummy umami waft you get when you open the lid. With the cheese it tastes like they were going for as much umami as possible in one dish. There is a lot of carrots in it which makes it taste sweeter as you keep eating, for me I couldn't finish cause the sweetness was just a touch too much halfway in, but will be amazing leftovers for later. Will be good with some oshinko (pickles).\nKani Salad: imitation crab and cabbage with kupi mayo. Also too sweet, especially when eaten with the curry. Just a squeeze of lemon would make a huge difference. Next time I would order side of chicken katsu instead of salad.\nService was kinda slow, but I was the only customer in between lunch and dinner, so I don't expect much anyways, it's a boring time for waitstaff, so I understand.\nMeal was not served with any napkins. But I normally travel with a handkerchief ever since I took a trip to Japan, so maybe it's cultural? No idea, but hey it's more eco-friendly :) so I'm good with it.",
