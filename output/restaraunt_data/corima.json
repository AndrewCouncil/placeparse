The service was excellent, and most of the menu hit the mark, if not exceeded it. I should note that you don\u2019t actually see the menu in advance (though they do give you a copy at the end), and I loved the surprise factor. The top dishes of the evening for me were a perfectly cooked and succulent mackerel and a wonderfully spiced branzino collar. And unbeknownst to me beforehand as well was that the chef spent time in Shanghai, and several of the dishes had hints of Asian flavors - I definitely detected a hint of the scallion pancakes I\u2019d get when I lived in Shanghai in the tortillas. On top of the incredible food and service, I had a front-row seat at the counter overlooking the open kitchen, and it was impressive to watch all the dishes being prepared. This is one of my new favorite restaurants! I\u2019ll definitely be back!",

      "text": "Corima, a newly Michelin-starred restaurant and recent James Beard Award nominee, still feels like a hidden gem tucked away in Manhattan\u2019s Chinatown. This was easily one of the most inventive and memorable tasting menu experiences I\u2019ve had. Chef Fidel Caballero\u2019s Northern Mexican-inspired cuisine\u2014rooted in sustainability and bold creativity\u2014offers a refreshing and forward-thinking culinary perspective.\n\nThe meal opens strong with dishes like the branzino collar, which delivers an impressive depth of flavor. The scallop course is light and bright, balanced with just the right touch of spice. The standout of the night, however, is the veal brain taco with bay leaf\u2014a daring and impeccably seasoned dish that\u2019s both texturally unique and deeply flavorful. The tortillas alone are extraordinary\u2014unlike anything I\u2019ve had before.\n\nDesserts round out the evening with thoughtful variety, adding a final touch to an already remarkable experience. Corima is an exceptional and exciting addition to New York\u2019s fine dining scene, and one that truly deserves more attention.",

      "text": "Hot take: best 1-Michelin tasting menu experience in NYC.\n\nI came to Corima for my birthday. My girlfriend knows I love to try fancy restaurants but that I tend to love spicy, flavorful cuisines the most. Corima is exactly that- spicy, herby, flavorful. Even though it\u2019s a fancy Michelin star place, it does not compromise on its Mexican flavors or make the too frequent mistake of whitewashing its cuisine. Everything here tastes flavorful and rich.\n\nWhile I won\u2019t recap the whole menu, the central theme is dishes that are plated beautifully with usual Michelin star skill, but with flavors that feel authentic to Mexico, and of course with ingredients that are indeed from Mexico. My favorite of the bunch was the taco, which featured a crispy layer of fried rooster skin as well as a ton of herbs and spices. I also loved the steak with mole sauce, which felt different from the usual rare ribeye with only butter and thyme you get at most upscale restaurants. My other favorites would probably be the crispy branzino collar and the cuttlefish soup that changes color when you mix it (see the video).\n\nOverall, the menu was truly mindblowingly good and left me feeling like I had the best 1 Michelin star meal of my life so far. Service was amazing as well- every dish was explained very well and we felt attended to throughout. I also loved our seats, as we got to sit right up front watching the open kitchen. It was pretty cool to watch the chefs work and call out orders and such- I\u2019d highly recommend the counter seats.\n\nOverall, this is a must visit experience in NYC and maybe the best 1 Michelin star tasting menu in NYC. Definitely check it out.",

      "text": "This is an absolute must try in New York and is off the charts good: every single dish is a masterclass in how to accentuate the flavor of each individual ingredient and marry it with sometimes surprising ingredients so well you\u2019ll start wondering why you haven\u2019t tried it anywhere before. Each dish has a great balance of fat, acidity, spice and umami. The acidity in all dishes is extremely fresh and leaves you wanting to take another bite of be it the mackerel or the wagyu, that in themselves are delightful. The good old tortilla to mop up the sauce and the butter on the side-just great. Can\u2019t fault the food, the atmosphere or even the drinks - great mix of Mexican and Asian flavors that work really well with the menu. One absolutely must come here monthly to see what the chef comes up with for the next seasonal menu.",

      "text": "Absolutely phenomenal meal. Chef Fidel and Sofia's incredibly hard work is evident in every bite. We dined at the Chef's counter and it was one of our most memorable meals in NY in years.\n\nWhen every other restaurant popping up in NY serves the same hipster hamachi crudo, Chef Fidel's creativity is a shining star amongst the sea of mediocrity in the NY dining scene. It is obvious from the first bites why Corima got it's star in under a year.\n\nThe entire team was a well-oiled machine and watching them work was like witnessing an orchestra perform a masterpiece. It meant so much to me that Eliana and the entire kitchen staff took my allergies so seriously.\n\nMariano's wine pairings were exquisite and perfectly complemented Chef Fidel's different ranges of tasting notes in each dish.\n\nWe will absolutely be back very very soon.",
