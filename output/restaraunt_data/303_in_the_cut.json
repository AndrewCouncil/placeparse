I was so excited to try the dirty dog (cheese sauce on top) and the cheese cake in the cut. The server guy was amazing and so funny, the perfect amount of chatty. He even matched my cousin and my energy while we were waiting! Which made the experience even better.\nI will definitely go back again!!",

      "text": "I have been following this place for years on social media.  The hype had me wondering if it could really be so good.\nY'all... It was so good.\nI got the Crackin Fried Chicken Fries, Tiramisu, Churros, and limeade.\nThe chicken was sooo tender, but the batter was super crispy, EVEN AFTER TAKING IT HOME. The fries didn't stay as crispy after I took them home, but the texture from the chicken made it work.  The fries are so well seasoned. The SAUCES!!! The creamy garlic was my favorite. The cheese was also great.\nI am not a pickle person, but the pickle slices are a great addition.  I would recommend trying them with the chicken and fries.\nThe tiramisu was the best I've had that didn't have coffee liqueur.  Extra cocoa, which added some extra chocolatey flavor. The marscapone was great, too. Lady fingers were soaked, but not so much they lost all their texture.\nChurros were filled with cream. I am so picky on churros. You can tell these guys take their food seriously.\nThe prickly pear limeade hit like a freight train. Perfect balance of sweet and sour and tangy.\n\nThe experience was great, too.  Everyone was kind, supportive, and the food came out asap.\n\nI will come back to Vegas for this chicken again.",

      "text": "I\u2019ve been seeing this food truck pop up on my Instagram feed for months, and I finally had the chance to try it while visiting Las Vegas. It\u2019s located in the parking lot of a strip club, definitely a unique setting, but there was no line, and the service was excellent.\n\nI ordered a slice of tiramisu, and it was absolutely delicious. Rich, creamy, and full of flavor, it definitely lived up to the taste expectations. However, for the price of that single slice, I felt like I could\u2019ve bought an entire cake elsewhere. The hype and maybe a bit of clever marketing seem to have inflated the price.\n\nI get that it\u2019s located in Las Vegas, just off the Strip, but even so, I believe the slice could be priced under $10. Still, it was a great treat, and I\u2019m curious to try the cheesecake next time, since that seems to be their most popular dessert.",

      "text": "A small food truck in the parking lot of a strip joint, lol.\nOwner friendly and talkative. We initially saw him and his business on a social media page talking about thr food, so we decided since we were driving to Vegas from Arizona anyways, we would put this on our list of places to try.\nI was impressed with the burrito, my hubby and I shared one since they are big and we wanted to get both desserts so we had to have some room in our tummy. The burrito came  with beans inside and I absolutely hate beans of any kind but my husband loves them so I left them in there and just ate it anyways. Know what? I could barely taste them anyways because the burrito was stuff with so much stuff, I didn't pay attention to the beans, ha. We also got a side of French fries and those were so dang good, I said next time, I would have them put some of the fries inside the burrito for that extra crunch..ya baby! The burrito was damn delicious. Now i had to get the cheesecake since owner claims it's the best in Las Vegas, it's decent but not something I would get again, I am a cheesecake junkie but I am very picky about my cheesecake and I love Juniors cheesecake the best. With that being said, both places are different style cheesecakes and like I said it's good but not great, sorry.....Now, we also got the tiramisu, which by the way, WAS THE BEST I have ever ever ever had and I would get this each and everytime I come to Vegas. I might even get 2 slices. The portions are huge and worth it's weight in gold. It's not overly sweet, it's just right. Next time I want to try the fried chicken fries and of course get the tiramisu. Who would have thought a food truck would be that good! Prices are somewhat high, but when you're on vacation,  everything goes...Do yourself a favor, run don't walk and get yourself some 303 in the Cut, you wont be sorry. Until next time \ud83e\udd70",
